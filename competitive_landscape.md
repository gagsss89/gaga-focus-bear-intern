# Understand competitive landscape

## Reflection

**Competitors Reviewed**
- Freedom – distraction blocker
- Cold Turkey – strict level blocking system
- Tiimo – visual routine planner with accessibility focus
- Routinery – timed habit routines

**What makes Focus Bear different?**

Focus Bear stands out because it:

- Combines routines + motivation + distraction blocking in one app
- Has a warm, supportive design that feels friendly rather than strict
- Helps with well-being, not just productivity
- Is created by people with ADHD, so:
    - The product is based on real lived experience
    - Users feel understood and supported
- Although optimized for ADHD needs, anyone can benefit from building better routines and reducing distractions

**Why would users choose Focus Bear?**

I would choose Focus Bear over other apps because:

- The UI is more attractive and comforting than most productivity tools
- It supports habits + blocking + motivation all in one place
- It feels warm, positive, and encouraging
- It supports all types of users, not only those with ADHD

For users who value encouragement, warmth, and a supportive experience, Focus Bear is the better choice. Tiimo, on the other hand, has a more polished and professional visual style, which may appeal to users who prefer a sleeker and more serious productivity look.

**Competitor Features Focus Bear Doesn’t Have (Yet)**

- AI smart planning assistance (Tiimo has “Plan with AI”)
- Some apps have embedded guided videos or audio for routines


---

**Proposed Improvement for Focus Bear**

When starting a habit in a routine (e.g., morning yoga):

Current behavior:
1. User taps a link
2. Redirects to YouTube or browser
3. Risk of distraction

Suggested improvement:
> Add a **built-in media/video player** to run guided routines without leaving the Focus Bear app.

This would:

- reduce distractions  
- create a smoother experience  
- increase user success with routines

##  Final Thoughts

Focus Bear has a unique role in the productivity market:
- Supportive instead of strict
- Designed with real ADHD experience
- Helpful for everyone who wants better focus and healthier routines

Adding modern AI capabilities and embedded content delivery could strengthen its position as a top choice for both productivity and well-being.
