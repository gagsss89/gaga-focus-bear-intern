# Working in an Agile Team

## Reflection

What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?
- Agile is a modern way of managing work where teams do small parts of a project step by step. Unlike the traditional Waterfall method, Agile allows teams to go back, make changes, and fix things before moving forward, while Waterfall requires finishing one full phase before starting the next.  
The biggest benefit of Agile is flexibility. The team can adapt quickly if requirements change. It also helps with better communication and faster delivery of results.  
One of the biggest challenges is keeping up with frequent changes or short deadlines during sprints that usually last 2-4 weeks.


How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities? 
- Agile principles can help me stay more organized, focused, and adaptable. Breaking work into smaller steps makes tasks easier to manage and less stressful. Since Agile includes many meetings like planning, grooming, daily stand-ups, demos, and retrospectives, it really encourages communication with the team. These regular check-ins help everyone stay aligned, share progress, and solve issues faster. 


## Task

Summarize the main differences between Scrum and Kanban in your own words. 
- Scrum methodology is more structured, work is done in short time periods called sprints (usually 2–4 weeks). Each sprint has a clear goal, and the team reviews progress after every cycle. Scrum, for example, works well for apps like **Spotify**, where developers plan new features, test them, and release updates regularly.  
Kanban is more flexible and there are no fixed sprints. Tasks move continuously through stages like To Do, In Progress, and Done. It focuses on keeping work flowing smoothly and limiting how many tasks are done at once. Kanban fits better for apps like **Focus Bear**, where work is ongoing, and tasks or improvements are made continuously based on user needs.

Identify one Agile principle you think will be most useful in your work.

- The Agile idea that helps me most is staying flexible and ready to adjust when plans change. In real work, things don’t always go as expected. Sometimes new bugs appear or priorities shift. I’ve learned that being open to change and quick to adapt helps the team stay productive and positive. It also reminds me to communicate with my teammates and find solutions together instead of stressing when something unexpected happens.
