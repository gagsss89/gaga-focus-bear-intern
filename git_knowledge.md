# Git Knowledge & Reflection

**Have you used Git before? If so, in what context?**
Yes. I have used Git in both IntelliJ and Visual Studio Code for managing my project files. I used Git to:
- Create branches
- Commit changes
- Push code to GitHub
- Resolve merge conflicts
- Submit pull requests

I am currently using Git as part of my internship tasks to track progress and collaborate through version control.

**Which Git client did you choose? Why?**

I chose to use **Git integration inside IntelliJ** and I am now learning to use **Git in VS Code for the first time**.  
I want to become familiar with VS Code because many modern QA and automation tools use it, and learning both clients will help me be more flexible in future projects.

Using both clients gives me flexibility depending on what type of work I am doing.

**What was the most interesting thing you learned today?**
The most interesting thing I learned is that **merge conflicts are not errors** — they are a normal part of working with Git.

It was exciting to learn how Git:
- Detects changes made on different branches
- Stops merges to avoid losing important updates
- Allows the developer to choose the correct version of the code
