# Data Privacy & Confidentiality

## Reflection

What steps can you take to ensure you handle data securely in your daily tasks?  
- Ican try to keep all information private and safe. For example, I don’t open or share work files on public Wi-Fi, and I only use secure websites like GitHub or Focus Bear. I also make sure to lock my laptop when I step away and never type personal or company details into AI tools or online forms.

How should you store, share, and dispose of sensitive information safely?  
- I save important files in protected folders on my laptop. If I need to share something, I send it only to the right person and through safe apps, not social media or messages. When I delete a file, I make sure it’s really gone and not still in my recycle bin.

What are some common mistakes that lead to data privacy issues, and how can they be avoided? 
- Some common mistakes are forgetting to log out, using the same password everywhere, or sending private info to the wrong person. To avoid this, I use strong passwords, check who I’m sending files to, and try to stay alert when working. I also keep my software updated so my laptop stays secure.


## Task

Identify at least one habit or practice you can adopt to improve data security in your role.  
- I started paying more attention to how I store and share files. From now on, I’ll keep all my work data in secure, password-protected folders and avoid saving anything sensitive on my desktop or personal drives. I also plan to review my passwords regularly and use two-factor authentication where possible.

Document at least one key learning or security measure you will implement.  
- The main thing I’m putting into practice is being careful before sending or uploading any file. I double-check who I’m sharing information with and make sure it’s done through a secure channel. I also keep my laptop locked whenever I step away and delete any old files, including emptying the recycle bin.
