# Occupational Health & Safety (OHS) for Desk-Based Work

## Reflection – Workspace and Habits

What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup?  
- I recently bought a new ergonomic chair that supports my back and keeps my legs at the right angle. I also lifted my laptop using a laptop stand so the screen is at eye level, which helps reduce neck strain. For now, I’m still waiting for the rest of my equipment (like an external monitor and keyboard), which I expect to receive next month. Once everything is set up, my workspace will be more comfortable and better aligned with ergonomic guidelines.

What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain?
- I try to remind myself to sit upright and relax my shoulders while working. The Focus Bear app also helps by reminding me to take stretching breaks and start my day with healthy habits like breathing exercises, drinking a glass of water, and taking a short walk before I begin work. These routines help me stay focused and prevent stiffness during the day.

How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day? 
- That’s still a challenging part for me, as I often forget to sit upright or get up for water. To help with this, I keep my water bottle next to my laptop and rely on Focus Bear reminders for posture checks and movement breaks. The app helps me stay consistent with these habits and build a healthier daily rhythm.


##  Task

Adjust your laptop setup based on ergonomic best practices.  
- I adjusted my laptop setup so that the window is now on my left side instead of behind me. This way, the light does not reflect on the screen, and it’s much easier on my eyes. I also raised my laptop slightly using a stand to keep the screen closer to my eye level and reduce neck strain.

Identify at least one piece of equipment that could improve your posture and comfort. 
- A new ergonomic chair was the biggest improvement. It provides good back support and keeps my legs at a proper 90-degree angle. I’m also planning to add an external keyboard and mouse soon to keep my hands and wrists in a more comfortable position.

Try using posture and movement reminders for a full workday and note any improvements.  
- I used the Focus Bear reminders for posture checks and movement breaks throughout the day. They helped me remember to stretch, take short walks, and adjust my sitting position. I noticed that I felt less tension in my neck and shoulders by the end of the day.

Document at least one workspace change or habit adjustment you made.  
- I changed my laptop’s position so the window is on my left side instead of behind me, which reduced glare and eye strain. A new ergonomic chair is a game changer. I also started keeping my water bottle next to my desk to remind myself to stay hydrated, and I rely on Focus Bear reminders to move and stretch regularly.
