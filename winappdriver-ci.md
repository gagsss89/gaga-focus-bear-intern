# Integrating WinAppDriver Tests into CI/CD

## Task


Research how E2E tests are integrated into CI/CD workflows
- E2E tests check complete user workflows, for example: logging in, making a purchase, logging out and verify that all parts of the system (front-end, back-end, database) work together.
I learned that E2E tests are usually triggered automatically after code is deployed to a test or staging environment.  
    - If the tests pass - the pipeline continues.  
    - If the tests fail - the deployment stops until the issue is fixed. 
  
    This ensures that no broken features reach production.

  
**Here is the simplified flow:**

    - Developer pushes new code  
    - CI builds the app and runs smaller tests  
    - The app is deployed to a test/staging environment  
    - E2E tests run and simulate real user actions  
    - If tests pass → deployment continues  
    -  If tests fail → pipeline stops until the issue is fixed

Explore how Appium-based tests (WinAppDriver) can run in a CI/CD pipeline
- Appium + WinAppDriver can be added as a step in the automated test stage of a CI/CD pipeline.  
They work together to test Windows desktop apps just like Selenium tests web applications.

- WinAppDriver helps Appium interact with buttons, text fields, and windows in the app.  
Instead of a person testing the app with a mouse, a robot does it automatically inside the pipeline.  
This allows the system to confirm that the app behaves correctly before releasing a new version.

Understand how test failures impact the deployment process  
- If E2E tests fail, the CI/CD pipeline immediately marks the build as failed and stops deployment.  
This prevents bad code from reaching production and lets the team fix issues before users see them.

### Run a test locally in “headless” mode to simulate CI execution

- Headless mode means the test runs without opening the app or browser window, everything happens in the background.  
  It's like a little invisible robot is clicking and checking things even though you can’t see the screen.  
  CI systems usually don’t have a display, so tests run headless to match how they run in the pipeline.

- In my previous QA Bootcamp automation project, I worked with web-based E2E testing using Selenium WebDriver. I learned how to automate real user actions such as logging in, navigating pages, verifying data, and interacting with UI elements.

  Because my tests were web-based, I was able to run them in **headless mode**, where the browser does not open visually — the test runs in the background. This is helpful to simulate how tests run in a CI/CD pipeline, where there is often no visible screen.

Example snippet using Selenium in headless mode (Java):

```java
ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions();
options.addArguments("--headless");
WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(options);

driver.get("https://www.google.com");
System.out.println("Page title: " + driver.getTitle());

driver.quit();  
```


## Reflection

How does running tests in CI/CD help maintain application stability? 
- Running automated tests in CI/CD makes sure that every change is tested right away.  
If something breaks, the pipeline stops before the issue reaches real users.  
This keeps the application stable and reduces production bugs.

What are the challenges of running GUI-based tests in CI/CD pipelines? 
- GUI tests require a visible screen and can be slower and harder to run on remote machines.  
They depend on timing, UI elements, and environment setup, which can make them less stable in CI.

How can flaky tests be handled in a CI/CD environment? 
- We can retry failed tests, improve waiting conditions, fix unstable locators, and monitor failures over time.  
Flaky tests should be reviewed and improved so they don’t block deployments.

What would be the next steps to fully integrate Focus Bear’s automated tests into its deployment pipeline? 
- Set up a Windows test environment in CI, run tests automatically on each update,  
generate reports for the team, and stop deployment if tests fail.  
Better logging and screenshots would also help debug failures faster.
