# Integrating WinAppDriver Tests into CI/CD

## Task


Research how E2E tests are integrated into CI/CD workflows
- E2E tests check complete user workflows, for example: logging in, making a purchase, logging out and verify that all parts of the system (front-end, back-end, database) work together.
I learned that E2E tests are usually triggered automatically after code is deployed to a test or staging environment.  
    - If the tests pass - the pipeline continues.  
    - If the tests fail - the deployment stops until the issue is fixed. 
  
    This ensures that no broken features reach production.

  
**Here is the simplified flow:**

    - Developer pushes new code  
    - CI builds the app and runs smaller tests  
    - The app is deployed to a test/staging environment  
    - E2E tests run and simulate real user actions  
    - If tests pass → deployment continues  
    -  If tests fail → pipeline stops until the issue is fixed

Explore how Appium-based tests (WinAppDriver) can run in a CI/CD pipeline
- Appium + WinAppDriver can be added as a step in the automated test stage of a CI/CD pipeline.  
They work together to test Windows desktop apps just like Selenium tests web applications.

- WinAppDriver helps Appium interact with buttons, text fields, and windows in the app.  
Instead of a person testing the app with a mouse, a robot does it automatically inside the pipeline.  
This allows the system to confirm that the app behaves correctly before releasing a new version.

Understand how test failures impact the deployment process  
- If E2E tests fail, the CI/CD pipeline immediately marks the build as failed and stops deployment.  
This prevents bad code from reaching production and lets the team fix issues before users see them.

### Run a test locally in “headless” mode to simulate CI execution

- Headless mode means the test runs without opening the app or browser window, everything happens in the background.  
  It's like a little invisible robot is clicking and checking things even though you can’t see the screen.  
  CI systems usually don’t have a display, so tests run headless to match how they run in the pipeline.

- In my previous QA Bootcamp automation project, I worked with web-based E2E testing using Selenium WebDriver. I learned how to automate real user actions such as logging in, navigating pages, verifying data, and interacting with UI elements.

  Because my tests were web-based, I was able to run them in **headless mode**, where the browser does not open visually — the test runs in the background. This is helpful to simulate how tests run in a CI/CD pipeline, where there is often no visible screen.

Example snippet using Selenium in headless mode (Java):

```java
ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions();
options.addArguments("--headless");
WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(options);

driver.get("https://www.google.com");
System.out.println("Page title: " + driver.getTitle());

driver.quit();  
```
