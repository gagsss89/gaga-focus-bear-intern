# Cyber Security

## Reflection

What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?  
- I already use unique passwords for my main accounts, keep my laptop updated, and avoid clicking unknown links or downloading from untrusted sources.  
My phone and laptop are also set to lock automatically if not used for a few minutes/seconds, which helps protect my data.  
I can improve by enabling 2FA on more accounts and by being more careful to lock my screen every time I step away from the device.

How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?  
- I will lock my laptop automatically when I get up, use strong passwords generated by a password manager, and keep my work apps updated.  
With regular reminders and practice, these habits will become automatic parts of my routine.

What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure? 

I will:
- Use a password manager to store strong, unique passwords
- Enable Two-Factor Authentication on all important accounts
- Never share passwords with anyone
- Change passwords if I notice anything suspicious

---


What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account? 
- I would immediately change my password and enable 2FA if it was not already active.  
Then I would report the issue to my supervisor or security contact right away so they can take action and prevent further damage.

## Task


- I checked my important accounts and made sure they have strong, unique passwords.  
I am enabling Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) wherever it is available to add an extra layer of security.

- I currently use the built-in password manager on my phone and laptop to securely store and autofill passwords.  
This helps me avoid reusing the same password for multiple accounts.
 
- My laptop and phone are already set to automatically lock after a short time of inactivity.  
This helps protect work data if I step away from my desk.
 
- A new habit I will follow is locking my screen **every time** I walk away from my computer, even if itâ€™s just for a moment.  
I will also be more careful about verifying suspicious emails and links before clicking anything.
