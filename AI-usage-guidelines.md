# AI Usage Guidelines

## Reflection

- When should you use AI for assistance, and when should you rely on your own skills?\*\*  
  I use AI mainly to assist me when I need help improving my writing, grammar, or structure. For example, after I write my reflections or documentation, I ask AI to correct mistakes and make sentences clearer. However, I always rely on my own knowledge and skills to create the main content and ideas. I believe AI should support my work, not replace my thinking.

- How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?\*\*  
  I avoid over-reliance by doing the work myself first and using AI only to review or double-check it. This helps me continue learning and developing my own skills while still benefiting from the accuracy and time-saving that AI provides. I make sure that AI suggestions fit my style and understanding.

- What steps will you take to ensure data privacy when using AI tools?\*\*  
  I never share private or confidential information with AI tools. That includes personal data, company details, or anything related to my projects. If I use examples, I always keep them general.

## Task

- Identify one task you can improve using an AI tool, and try it out.  
  I’ve used ChatGPT several times during my internship to improve my work. For example, when writing my reflections and Focus Bear answers, I created the content myself and then asked the AI to correct grammar, improve sentence flow, and make it sound more natural.

      Besides related websites, I also used ChatGPT for research about my previous tasks to get a better understanding of Focus Bear features. When I was researching Focus Bear, ADHD, and Autism, AI helped me summarize information, find reliable sources, and understand how supportive technology can make daily routines easier for people with different needs. This helped me connect better with the company’s mission and made my reflections more meaningful.

- Review the AI-generated output critically — did it require editing or fact-checking?  
  Yes, I always review and edit the AI’s output carefully. Sometimes it changes my tone or adds information I didn’t intend to include, so I double-check and rewrite parts that don’t sound like me. When using AI for writing or research, I verify the details with reliable sources or by checking things myself.

- Document one best practice you will follow when using AI tools at Focus Bear.  
  My best practice is to always create my own work first, then use AI only for support — like reviewing, correcting, or rephrasing. I never share private or company information, and I always double-check the final version for accuracy. AI helps me improve my writing, communication, and technical understanding, but the main ideas and learning always come from me.
