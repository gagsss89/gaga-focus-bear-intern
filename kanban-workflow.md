# Agile Workflows & Kanban

## Reflection

How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?  
- Kanban makes the work more visible and easier to understand. By seeing all tasks on the board, it becomes clear what is most important and what needs attention first. Limiting how many tasks can be “In Progress” at the same time helps avoid overload and multitasking. This will keep me focused and reduces stress, because you finish one thing before starting another.

How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?  
- I can improve my workflow by keeping my tasks organized and always updating their status on the board. I will also try to limit how many tasks I work on at the same time so I can complete them faster and avoid getting stuck. Checking the board regularly helps me stay on track and understand what my priorities are. These small changes help me enjoy my work without feeling overwhelmed.


## Task – Kanban Board


Check out Focus Bear’s Kanban board and note how tasks are structured. 
- I checked the Kanban board in GitHub and noticed that it has many different columns.
The team designed the board based on their own workflow and business priorities.
Instead of the usual “To Do → In Progress → Done” process, tasks are organized by importance and business stages.

Some of the columns include:
- Super low priority
- Very low priority
- Blocked
- Next fundraising round
- Untriaged Low Priority
- Ready for QA
- Ready for Dev
- QA Passed / Done

This setup helps the team focus on tasks that matter most at the right time and easily see what is blocked or waiting.

Here is the board I reviewed in GitHub Projects and it is structured by priority levels and business goals.

Move at least one task through the Kanban process and update its status correctly. 
- I am currently unable to move or update any cards on the board, most likely due to not having the needed permissions.
To still keep my progress visible, I will continue updating status inside my assigned GitHub issues and add comments as I complete steps.

Identify one way you can improve task tracking in your role. 
- To improve task tracking, I will update my GitHub issues more frequently and write short progress notes.
This will help the team follow my work even if I cannot directly update the Kanban board.
It also reduces confusion and keeps everyone aligned on what has been completed.
