# Professionalism at Focus Bear

## Reflection

Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism? What made it effective?  
- Yes, I was very fortunate in my previous role to have an amazing and supportive team.  
Everyone communicated clearly, shared their progress and blockers regularly, and always helped each other when someone was stuck.  
We respected each other’s ideas, kept a positive attitude, and focused on solutions instead of blame.  
That environment made work enjoyable and helped us deliver better results together.

What steps can you take to make sure your communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive? 
- I will be polite and positive in messages, ask questions when something is unclear, and always assume good intentions.  
- I will avoid short or confusing responses and pay attention to my tone.

---

How can you help create a positive, fun, and professional work environment?  
- I can bring a positive attitude and stay motivated, even when tasks are challenging.  
I will be happy to receive feedback because it helps me grow and become better at what I do.  
By encouraging others, celebrating progress, and showing appreciation for everyone’s work,  
I can help make the team environment supportive, friendly, and professional.

---

How can you prepare effectively for meetings with supervisors and colleagues?  
- Before meetings, I will review my tasks, write down questions, and be ready to give short updates.  
This helps make meetings efficient and shows respect for everyone’s time.

What would it look like to be proactive during your internship?  
- Trying to solve problems first, but asking for help early when stuck.  
- Updating tasks in GitHub without waiting to be reminded.  
- Looking for opportunities to learn and contribute.
- I also want to show appreciation for this opportunity and respect everyone’s time.  
  That means coming prepared to meetings, asking clear questions, and focusing on solutions instead of problems.  
  By staying curious, motivated, and responsible, I can learn faster and contribute more to the team.

How might you follow up with colleagues or supervisors if you need information/action from them? How would you escalate it further if you don't get a response and when would you escalate?

- If I need information or support, I will first follow up politely with the person responsible, either through a message or comment on the task.  
I believe most issues can be solved through clear communication without escalation.  
If I still don’t receive a response, I will ask another team member or bring it up during a stand-up meeting so the whole team is aware.

- Only if the situation is urgent and blocking the team, a “house on fire” moment, I would escalate by sending a more direct message or tagging a supervisor to make sure it gets attention quickly.  
Escalation would be my last option, used only when necessary to keep the work moving.

---

What are some things you won't do?
- I will not ignore messages, blame others, complain without suggesting solutions, or speak disrespectfully.  
- I won’t wait too long to communicate blockers or hide mistakes, I want to learn and help the team succeed.
