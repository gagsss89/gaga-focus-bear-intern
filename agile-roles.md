# Roles in an Agile Team

## Reflection

What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?  
- My role is QA (Quality Assurance), and my main goal is to make sure that the product is bug-free and meets all requirements before it reaches end users. I try to find and report bugs early, so they can be fixed before release. My work doesn’t start only in the testing stage, I’m involved from the beginning. As soon as we get the acceptance criteria (AC), I review the documentation, write test cases, and prepare test scenarios. I also do manual testing to make sure every feature works as expected and follows the requirements.

How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?
- I work closely with developers to test and verify their code, report any bugs I find, and discuss them together to figure out the best solution. I communicate with the Product Manager to understand requirements and priorities. I also attend all Scrum ceremonies like planning, grooming, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives, along with other team members, where I share testing updates and discuss issues. This teamwork helps us find and fix problems faster, improve the product quality, and deliver better results together.


## Task

Write a short description of how your role fits into the Agile team.  
- As a QA (Quality Assurance) team member, my role is to make sure the product is bug-free and meets all the requirements before release. I’m involved from the very beginning, starting with reviewing documentation, writing test cases, and testing new features manually or through automation. My goal is to find issues early and make sure everything works smoothly for end users. By doing this, I help the whole Agile team deliver a high-quality product faster and with more confidence.

Identify one other role you frequently collaborate with and describe how you can improve teamwork with them. 
- I work most closely with developers. After I test new features, I report bugs and discuss them with developers to find the best way to fix them. To improve teamwork, I always double-check every issue I find to make sure it’s real and not a false report. This saves the team’s time and avoids confusion. I also try to communicate earlier in the process, like during test case writing or feature discussions, to prevent misunderstandings.
