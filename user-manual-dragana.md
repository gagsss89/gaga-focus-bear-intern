# User Manual for Dragana

## My role

- I am working on reviewing the onboarding automated scripts as part of my QA Automation Internship tasks.
- The days and times I work are Monday to Friday, approximately 9 AM â€“ 3 PM, totaling 30 hours per week.

## How i work best

- I do my best work when:
 
    - I am well rested
    - I have a good collaboration with my team
    - I understand the task very well

- I struggle when:
  
    - I don't understand what is expected from my side
    - I get interrupted constantly

## Communication style

- I prefer messages to be very detailed and direct.
- The best way to reach me is via email for most general matters. For the matters that require more time, set up the meeting.
- If the issue is urgent or I have not responded to your email in a timely manner, I do not mind receiving a phone call.


## Collaboration & Teamwork

- I work best in a team:
    - When I understand the task, and the specific responsibilities assigned to each member.
    - When the team is relaxed and we can joke and communicate openly.
    - When I have prepared well for the task.
  
- My biggest pet peeve in teamwork is:
    - Unnecessary meetings
    - Unclear instructions
    - Not responding to emails or calls
  
- If I seem quiet in a meeting, it usually means:
    
    - I am focused on understanding the task
    - Picking up every detail, trying to remember everything ( I don't usually ask a lot of questions).
  

## Focus & Productivity

- I stay focused by taking short breaks to maintain concentration.
- Things that distract me the most is interruption with unrelated issues.
- The best way to support my productivity is to tell your expectations clearly and to trust me to fulfill my responsibilities.


## Feedback & Growth

- I like feedback to be honest and direct but at the same time gentle.
- When I make a mistake, the best way to let me know is directly. I would also appreciate helping me figure out the best way to correct the mistakes.
- I appreciate it when teammates

  - Are willing to help when needed.
  - Recognize good work.
  - Are happy to have a coffee together.


## Fun Facts & Quirks

- One thing people often misunderstand about me is that my quietness sometimes gets mistaken for a lack of interest, but it is actually only focusing on important things.
- A fun fact about me: I first worked as an economist, then retrained as a nurse, and now I want to work and grow as a QA. I have finally found my true profession.
- My work superpower is that I have experience in different types of jobs, and all of them required a high level of seriousness and attention to detail.
