+# Understand competitive landscape
+
+## Reflection
+
+**Competitors Reviewed**
+- Freedom – distraction blocker
+- Cold Turkey – strict level blocking system
+- Tiimo – visual routine planner with accessibility focus
+- Routinery – timed habit routines
+
+---
+
+**What makes Focus Bear different?**
+
+Focus Bear stands out because it:
+
+- Combines routines + motivation + distraction blocking in one app
+- Has a warm, supportive design that feels friendly rather than strict
+- Helps with well-being, not just productivity
+- Is created by people with ADHD, so:
+    - The product is based on real lived experience
+    - Users feel understood and supported
+- Although optimized for ADHD needs, anyone can benefit from building better routines and reducing distractions
+
+
+
+---
+
+**Why would users choose Focus Bear?**
+
+I would choose Focus Bear over other apps because:
+
+- The UI is more attractive and comforting than most productivity tools
+- It supports habits + blocking + motivation all in one place
+- It feels warm, positive, and encouraging
+- It supports all types of users, not only those with ADHD
+
+For users who value encouragement, warmth, and a supportive experience, Focus Bear is the better choice. Tiimo, on the other hand, has a more polished and professional visual style, which may appeal to users who prefer a sleeker and more serious productivity look.
+
+---
+
+**Competitor Features Focus Bear Doesn’t Have (Yet)**
+
+- AI smart planning assistance (Tiimo has “Plan with AI”)
+- Some apps have embedded guided videos or audio for routines
+
+
+---
+
+**Proposed Improvement for Focus Bear**
+
+When starting a habit in a routine (e.g., morning yoga):
+
+Current behavior:
+1. User taps a link
+2. Redirects to YouTube or browser
+3. Risk of distraction
+
+Suggested improvement:
+> Add a **built-in media/video player** to run guided routines without leaving the Focus Bear app.
+
+This would:
+
+- reduce distractions  
+- create a smoother experience  
+- increase user success with routines
+
+---
+
+
+##  Final Thoughts
+
+Focus Bear has a unique role in the productivity market:
+- Supportive instead of strict
+- Designed with real ADHD experience
+- Helpful for everyone who wants better focus and healthier routines
+
+Adding modern AI capabilities and embedded content delivery could strengthen its position as a top choice for both productivity and well-being.

+# Interacting with Native Windows UI Elements
+
+## Task
+
+**Use inspect.exe or Appium Desktop to locate UI elements**
+
+### Inspect.exe Example: Locating a UI Element
+(https://github.com/gagsss89/gaga-focus-bear-intern/blob/main/FocusBear%20UI%20Element.png)
+
+Here is an example where I inspected the **Select Language** dropdown inside the Focus Bear Windows app.
+
+
+Inspect.exe shows useful element properties:
+
+- **ControlType**: Combo box 
+- **AutomationId**: cmbLanguage
+- **FrameworkId**: "WPF"
+- **ClassName**: "ComboBox"
+
+📌 Based on these properties, a valid WinAppDriver locator could be:
+
+
+        driver.findElement(By.id("cmbLanguage")).click();
+
+
+---
+
+
+**Write a test that clicks a button and verifies the result**
+
+https://github.com/gagsss89/gaga-focus-bear-intern/blob/main/SaveHabitsBTN.png
+
+    @Test
+    public void testSaveHabitsButton() {
+
+    //Find the Save Habits button by Name
+    WebElement saveButton = driver.findElement(By.name("Save Habits"));
+
+    //Perform click action
+    saveButton.click();
+
+    //Verify expected result — example: success message appears
+    WebElement confirmationMessage = driver.findElement(By.name("Successfully added habit"));
+    assertTrue(confirmationMessage.isDisplayed());
+}
+
+---
+
+**Automate typing into an input field and checking the entered value**
+
+https://github.com/gagsss89/gaga-focus-bear-intern/blob/main/inputField%20Screenshot.png
+
+    @Test
+    public void testEnterHabitName() {
+
+    // Locate the second Habit text input
+    WebElement habitInput = driver.findElement(By.xpath("(//Edit)[2]"));
+
+    // Enter habit name
+    String expectedText = "Walk";
+    habitInput.clear();
+    habitInput.sendKeys(expectedText);
+
+    // Verify typed value
+    String actualText = habitInput.getAttribute("Value.Value");
+    assertEquals(expectedText, actualText);
+}
+
+
+**Note**
+
+habitInput.getAttribute("Value.Value"); - What text is currently stored inside this input field?
+This makes it the correct way to verify text entry for desktop apps — instead of .getText() which often returns empty string in Windows UI automation.
+
+
+**Additional Note:**
+
+The Habit input field is hosted inside a WebView (FrameworkId = Chrome), not a native WPF/Win32 element. Because of this:
+
+- AutomationId was not available for this element
+- I used an XPath locator: (//Edit)[2])
+- To verify the text, I accessed "Value.Value" attribute (WebView behavior)
+- WinAppDriver needs this method to read typed text inside WebView input fields
+
+This shows the difference in automation strategies between **native Windows UI** and **WebViews**.
