# Set Up Dev Productivity Chrome Extensions

**Which extensions did you install? Why?**

I installed the following Chrome extensions:

- **React Developer Tools**  
  Because many modern web applications are built with React, and this tool allows me to inspect components, view props, and understand how the UI is structured.

- **Redux DevTools**  
  This extension helps me debug the application’s state. I can track how data changes as users interact with the UI, which is very useful for verifying correct behavior in end-to-end testing.

- **JSON Viewer Pro**  
  I installed this to format and easily read JSON responses from APIs. This is super helpful when doing API testing or checking if frontend data matches backend responses.

- **Lighthouse**  
  Lighthouse helps me evaluate performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices. It shows what can affect user experience and loading speed, which is important in testing web apps.

** What was the most useful thing I learned?**

The most useful thing I learned is how the **React Developer Tools** and **Redux DevTools** provide access to what is happening behind the UI — not just what the user sees.  

This improves debugging by letting me:

- Inspect the real data values inside components  
- Track state changes step-by-step  
- Identify where something breaks more quickly  
- Communicate issues clearly to frontend developers  

As many modern apps use these technologies, these tools will be helpful in my future QA automation and exploratory testing.
