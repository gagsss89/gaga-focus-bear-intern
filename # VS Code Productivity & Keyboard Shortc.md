## Reflection

### Which shortcuts will be most useful?

I think the **multiple cursors** shortcuts (`Alt + Click` and `Ctrl + D`) will have the biggest impact, because they allow me to edit many similar lines at once. Also navigation shortcuts like `Ctrl + P` help me switch files quickly during automation tasks.

### How do keyboard shortcuts improve productivity?

Keyboard shortcuts keep my hands on the keyboard, reduce clicking, prevent distractions, and make coding **much faster**, especially during:

- Updating multiple UI locators
- Debugging automation tests
- Managing files and test scripts efficiently
- Working with the terminal within VS Code

The more shortcuts I learn, the faster and happier I will be while coding!
