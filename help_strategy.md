# When to Use Google, AI Tools, or Ask for Help?


## Task

Below is my decision tree that I use when I run into a problem during coding or testing.  
I start with investigating the error myself, and then move step-by-step to different resources like Google, AI tools, teammates, or escalation if needed.

### Reflection 

When do you prefer using AI (like ChatGPT)?
- I need a quick and simple explanation of an error
- I want ideas for what to try next when I feel stuck
- I am looking for example code or help improving my code
- I want to confirm my understanding before asking someone else

AI feels like a tutor that can guide me — but I always double-check answers.

---

When do you prefer using Google?
- The error is common and already solved online
- I need official documentation or trusted tutorials
- I want to compare multiple sources to confirm accuracy

Google is good for reliable information that is widely used and tested.

---

How do you decide when to ask a colleague instead?
- I already tried AI and Google, but the issue is still blocking me
- The problem is related to Focus Bear’s internal setup or code
- I want to avoid wasting time guessing on something they already know

Asking the right person saves time for everyone and keeps progress moving.

What challenges do developers face when troubleshooting alone?
- Spending too much time on one issue
- Feeling frustrated or unsure what to try next
- Missing small details another person might see quickly
- Solving the wrong problem because the root cause isn’t clear

Having a strategy helps me stay productive and avoid feeling stuck.
