# Reflection 

## What do you hope to learn from this internship?
I hope to improve my skills and gain real experience with the tools I’ve learned so far. I would be thrilled to also learn new, modern tools such as Playwright and JavaScript-based automation, and get exposure to mobile testing, which has been on my wish list for a long time.

## What skills are you most excited to develop?
I am excited to have the opportunity to learn how mobile testing works, since nowadays we all use our phones more than laptops and computers. I also want to become confident in end-to-end testing and understand the full testing flow from UI to API and database. I look forward to improving communication in an agile team environment and contributing to high-quality releases.

## What do you think you can contribute to the team?
I bring strong attention to detail, motivation to learn quickly, and a very positive attitude. I am always ready to support the team, communicate clearly, and help ensure high-quality results through thorough testing and documentation.

## What is one area you feel less confident in that you’d like to improve?
I would like to improve my understanding of API testing and gain more hands-on experience with real APIs, ideally using tools like RestAssured or similar. This will help me feel more confident working independently on backend validations and integrating API checks in automation frameworks.

## What does success in this internship look like for you?
Success looks like becoming confident with the tools and technologies I use, being able to solve problems independently, and learning new skills that strengthen my resume. If I can walk away feeling more prepared for future roles and more confident in interviews, that will be a big achievement for me.
