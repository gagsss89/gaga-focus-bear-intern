# Terminal Knowledge & Reflection

**Which terminal client did you choose? Why?**

I am currently using **Windows Terminal with PowerShell**.  
It is already integrated with Windows, easy to open, and works well with Git commands such as `git status`, `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`.

I also used the terminal inside VS Code and IntelliJ, which makes it very convenient because I can run Git commands directly from my editor.

**What customizations (if any) did you make?**

So far, I have not added any advanced customizations, but I plan to explore themes and plugins later.  
For now, I have:

- Enabled Git in the terminal
- Practiced basic commands
- Used it to check Git version

**What was the most useful command you learned today?**

The most useful commands I used today were `git status`, `cd`, `git --version`, and `git add`. I have used these before during my automation work, but today I refreshed my knowledge and reminded myself how important they are in the daily Git and terminal workflow. These commands help me understand the current state of the project, navigate folders, verify my environment, and stage files correctly before committing.
