# Agile Ceremonies & Team Collaboration

## Reflection

How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?  
- Agile ceremonies make sure the whole team stays informed and aligned.  
We share progress, priorities, and any problems early, so we avoid delays or misunderstandings.  
These meetings help everyone move in the same direction and fix issues before they grow.

- Main Agile ceremonies are: Grooming meeting, Sprint Planning meeting, Daily Stand Up, Retro and Demo.

Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?

- For me as a QA, the most important ceremony is Backlog Refinement (Grooming).  
This is where I can ask questions about the acceptance criteria and make sure everything is clear before development begins. It helps me prepare test cases early and prevent defects later.

- Daily Stand-Ups are also very important for me.  
They help me share progress and quickly communicate any blockers that stop me from testing.

## Task

Attend a stand-up meeting and observe how updates are shared  
- This morning, I attended the stand-up meeting.  
A few team members were present, and the conversation was very efficient.  
Everyone briefly shared what they were working on and mentioned any blockers.  
The mentors were very supportive and helped remove obstacles so work can continue smoothly.

Participate in a retrospective or review past notes from one  
- I have not attended a retrospective yet, but I hope to join one soon.  
What I know so far is that a retro is a short meeting where the team reflects on:
- What went well
- What didnâ€™t go well
- What we can improve next time  
  This meeting is very important because it helps the team improve the way we work together.

Document one change you can make to improve your team collaboration  
- One change I can make to improve collaboration is to communicate more proactively.
  If I have a question or something is unclear, I will ask the team right away instead of waiting.
  This will help avoid delays and keep the workflow smoother for everyone.
