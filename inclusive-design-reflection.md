# Working with vulnerable population

## Reflection

- I can adjust my communication style by being patient, warm, and supportive.  
I try to understand that everyone has a different setup and way of working, and I avoid complex or long instructions.

- Some common UX and communication pitfalls include providing too much information at once, small text,unnecessary distractions, using vague instructions, or having unclear navigation.  

- As a practical change, I make sure my work, such as text, emails, or test cases are clear, direct, and easy to follow.


## Task

- First-Person Account

  I read an article called, [My Daily Work Routine and 4 Productivity Tools That Help Me Get Things Done](https://witanddelight.com/2025/02/work-routine-productivity-tools-for-adhd/),
  written by someone with ADHD who shared how they manage productivity.  
They learned to stop fighting their natural rhythm and instead created systems that work with their brain.  
They use simple tools like the **Notes app**, **Reminders**, **Notion**, and **pen and paper** to capture ideas and tasks.  
They also use four key tools:

    **Planner** - to plan weekly details

    **Timer** - for focus sessions 

    **Brick** - to block distracting phone apps

    **Headphones** - to reduce noise

  I liked the idea of not trying to follow complex systems, but creating routines that actually fit your own brain.  
    I can say that I also work better when I keep things organized, clear and minimal.

- Suggested Improvement for Focus Bear
    
    Add short, positive messages that appear after each task or focus session (“Nice job staying focused!” or “You took a healthy break, great work!”)


- Supportive Response Example
  - “Hi, thank you for reaching out! It’s completely okay to feel frustrated when staying focused feels difficult. Many people experience that. You might find it helpful to use shorter focus sessions and take gentle breaks in between. You’re doing great, and we’re here to help you find what works best for your rhythm.”
